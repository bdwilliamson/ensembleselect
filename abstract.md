In many applications, it is of interest to assess the relative contribution of features (or subsets of features) toward the goal of predicting a response; in other words, to gauge the variable importance of features. Most recent work on variable importance assessment has focused on describing the importance of features within the confines of a given prediction algorithm. However, such assessment does not necessarily characterize the prediction potential of features, and may provide a misleading reflection of the intrinsic value of these features. To address this limitation, I propose a general framework for nonparametric inference on interpretable algorithm-agnostic variable importance. I further discuss how this framework may be used for variable selection. I will illustrate the use of the proposed methods through numerical experiments and two applications: identifying important variables in HIV-1 prevention research and developing a panel of biomarkers for separating pancreatic cysts with differing malignancy potential.
